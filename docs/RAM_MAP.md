# Top Gear 2 USA RAM map

All addresses are guest 24-bit addresses. ROM disassembly is authoritative;
unknown fields remain zero in `game/game.toml` rather than borrowing Sonic data.

| Address | Size | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$FF8408` | base | A3 game-global addressing base | Reset `$001D4E`, scene handlers restore A3 |
| `$FFFFFE` | stack | Reset SSP, downward-growing | ROM vector `$000000` |
| `$FF01EA` | 6 bytes | V-int `JMP abs.l` trampoline | Installer `$00204C` |
| `$FF01EC` | long | Current V-int ROM target | Immediate store `$002054`, then scene installers |
| `$FFF9FE` | 6 bytes | H-int `JMP abs.l` trampoline | Installer `$00205E` |
| `$FFFA00` | long | Current H-int ROM target | Immediate store `$002066`, then scene installers |
| `$FF01C6` | word | Interrupt frame counter / VBlank wait handshake | `$002070` clear, `$0020B6` increment, `$002082` wait |
| `$FF16BE` | word | Attract/demo selection index (0..63) | `$001E58`, `$001E9E..001EAC`, indexes ROM `$01B8E8` |
| `$FF241C` | long | Selected attract descriptor pointer | `$001E5E` stores through A3-$5FEC |
| `$FF9F3C` | buffer | Graphics/decompression working buffer | `$01E816..01E840` |

Game mode, player speed and road/camera state have not yet been established.
The frame counter is 16-bit; generic runner telemetry treats its configured
address as a long, so raw word reads are the reliable counter measurement.

Further raw-ROM evidence from the race interrupt path:

| Address | Size | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$FF0000` | word | DMA command staging scratch | `$001222`, `$001228`, `$00123A`, `$001240` |
| `$FF0002` | word | Queued DMA command count | `$001278`, increment `$0012E0` |
| `$FF0006` | buffer | Queued VDP DMA register commands | `$001272..0012E0` |
| `$FF0108` | word | VDP mode-register command shadow | `$004732..00473A`, `$004880..004888` |
| `$FF01E6` | long | Alternate raster-list pointer | `$0048DC`, read by copied H-int `$0046FC` |
| `$FFF9FE..FFFA7F` | 130 bytes | Copied self-modifying raster H-int code | ROM `$004682..004703` copied by `$004654..00466A` |
| `$FF231E` | long | Primary raster-list pointer, loaded into A5 | A3-$60EA at `$004898` / `$0049D6` |
| `$FF2324` | long | Alternate raster-list offset | A3-$60E4 at `$0048D8` |
| `$FF232C` | long | Alternate raster-list base | A3-$60DC at `$0048CA` / `$0048D4` |
| `$FF238C` | word | Race V-int counter (parity schedules work) | A3-$607C increment `$004748`, tested `$00490A` |
| `$FF2734` | word | Active small-object callback count (bounded 64) | A3-$5CD4 at `$003CFA..003D04`, `$00E418` |
| `$FF2736` | 16-byte slots | Small objects with function pointer at +12 | `$003D12..003D18`, dispatcher `$00E422..00E430` |

The last two entries matter to the remaining moving-race corruption: at frame
3445, its indirect call unexpectedly targets noncode `$00058C` / `$0002C6`.
Do not add these to discovery: raw ROM contains invalid instructions there.
