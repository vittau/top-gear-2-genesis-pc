# Top Gear 2 USA RAM map

All addresses are guest 24-bit addresses. ROM disassembly is authoritative;
unknown fields remain zero in `game/game.toml` rather than borrowing Sonic data.

| Address | Size | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$FF8408` | base | A3 game-global addressing base | Reset `$001D4E`, scene handlers restore A3 |
| `$FFFFFE` | stack | Reset SSP, downward-growing | ROM vector `$000000` |
| `$FF01EA` | 6 bytes | V-int `JMP abs.l` trampoline | Installer `$00204C` |
| `$FF01EC` | long | Current V-int ROM target | Immediate store `$002054`, then scene installers |
| `$FFF9FE` | 6 bytes | H-int `JMP abs.l` trampoline | Installer `$00205E` |
| `$FFFA00` | long | Current H-int ROM target | Immediate store `$002066`, then scene installers |
| `$FF01C6` | word | Interrupt frame counter / VBlank wait handshake | `$002070` clear, `$0020B6` increment, `$002082` wait |
| `$FF16BE` | word | Attract/demo selection index (0..63) | `$001E58`, `$001E9E..001EAC`, indexes ROM `$01B8E8` |
| `$FF241C` | long | Selected attract descriptor pointer | `$001E5E` stores through A3-$5FEC |
| `$FF9F3C` | buffer | Graphics/decompression working buffer | `$01E816..01E840` |

Game mode, player speed and road/camera state have not yet been established.
The frame counter is 16-bit; generic runner telemetry treats its configured
address as a long, so raw word reads are the reliable counter measurement.
